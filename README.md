## Networking and Web Security
1. [IP](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.2.0?topic=internets-tcpip-tcp-udp-ip-protocols)
    * In terms of the OSI model, Internet Protocol (IP) is a network-layer protocol. It provides a datagram service between applications, supporting both TCP and UDP.
2. [TCP, UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)
    * In terms of the OSI model, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport-layer protocol. It provides a reliable virtual-circuit connection between applications; that is, a connection is established before data transmission begins. Data is sent without errors or duplication and is received in the same order as it is sent. No boundaries are imposed on the data; TCP treats the data as a stream of bytes.
3. [3-way handshake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/)
4. [HTTP, HTTPS](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/the-difference-between-http-and-https)
5. [DNS - How does it work?](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/)
6. [What happens when you click on a URL in your browser](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-happens-when-you-hit-url-in-your-browser/)
