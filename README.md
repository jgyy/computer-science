## Networking and Web Security

1. [IP](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.2.0?topic=internets-tcpip-tcp-udp-ip-protocols)
   - In terms of the OSI model, Internet Protocol (IP) is a network-layer protocol. It provides a datagram service between applications, supporting both TCP and UDP.
2. [TCP, UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)
   - In terms of the OSI model, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport-layer protocol. It provides a reliable virtual-circuit connection between applications; that is, a connection is established before data transmission begins. Data is sent without errors or duplication and is received in the same order as it is sent. No boundaries are imposed on the data; TCP treats the data as a stream of bytes.
   - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is also a transport-layer protocol and is an alternative to TCP. It provides an unreliable datagram connection between applications. Data is transmitted link by link; there is no end-to-end connection. The service provides no guarantees. Data can be lost or duplicated, and datagrams can arrive out of order.
3. [3-way handshake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/)
   - Step 1 (SYN): In the first step, the client wants to establish a connection with a server, so it sends a segment with SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) which informs the server that the client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with
   - Step 2 (SYN + ACK): Server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. Acknowledgement(ACK) signifies the response of the segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with
   - Step 3 (ACK): In the final part client acknowledges the response of the server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer
4. [4-way](https://www.wifi-professionals.com/2019/01/4-way-handshake)
   - The 4-way handshake is the process of exchanging 4 messages between an access point (authenticator) and the client device (supplicant) to generate some encryption keys which can be used to encrypt actual data sent over Wireless medium. These keys which are generated through 4-way handshake are generated by some source key material.
5. [HTTP, HTTPS](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/the-difference-between-http-and-https)
   - HTTP: No Data Encryption Implemented. Every URL link that begins with HTTP uses a basic type of “hypertext transfer protocol”. Created by Tim Berners-Lee back in the early 1990’s, when the Internet was still in its infancy, this network protocol standard is what allows web browsers and servers to communicate through the exchange of data.
   - HTTPS: Encrypted Connections. HTTPS is not the opposite of HTTP, but its younger cousin. The two are essentially the same, in that both of them refer to the same “hypertext transfer protocol” that enables requested web data to be presented on your screen. But, HTTPS is still slightly different, more advanced, and much more secure.
6. [DNS - How does it work?](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/)
   - DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).
7. [What happens when you click on a URL in your browser](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-happens-when-you-hit-url-in-your-browser/)
   - DNS lookup to find IP address. After hitting the URL, the first thing that needs to happen is to resolve IP address associated with the domain name. DNS helps in resolving this. DNS is like a phone book and helps us to provide the IP address that is associated with the domain name just like our phone book gives a mobile number which is associated with the person’s name.
